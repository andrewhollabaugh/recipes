# Spanakopita
- 1 kg (2lb) spinach
- 1 medium-sized onion, chopped
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 cup chopped spring onions
- 1/2 cup chopped parsely (no)
- 2 tsp chopped dill or fennel (no)
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg (dash)
- 1/2 cup mizithra or cottage cheese (V)
- 1 cup well-crumbled feta cheese (2 pkg feta)
- 1/4 cup finely grated kefalotiri or parmesan cheese (no)
- 4 eggs, lightly beaten
- salt, pepper
- 10 sheets fillo pastry
- melted butter for assembling pie

Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems. Chop coarsly and put into a large pan. Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan now and then or turning spinach with a fork. Heat just long enough to wilt spinach so tha tjuices can run out freely. Drain well in a colander, pressing occasionally with a spoon.

Gently fry onion in oil for 10 minutes, add spring onion and fry for further 5 minutes

Place drained spinach with onion-oil mixture in a large mixing bowl. Add herbs, nutmeg, cheeses and eggs and stir to combine. Check saltiness of mixture, then add salt and pepper to taste.

Brush a 25x30cm baking dish with butter and line with a sheet of filo pastry. Top with another 4 sheets, brushing each with butter.

Spread filling in pastry-lined dish and top with remaining fillo, brushing each sheet again with butter. Trim edges if necessary and tuck pastry in on all sides.

Brush top lightly with butter and score top layer of pastry lightly into squares using a sharp knife or razor blade. Sprinkle a little cold water on top to prevent pastry from curling up.

Bake in a moderate over for 45 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Remove from over and leave for 5 minutes before cutting into portions for serving.
