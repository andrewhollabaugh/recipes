# Tahu Goreng - Fried Tofu
- 1/4 lb bean sprouts, washed, drained
- 3 large iceberg-lettuce leaves, cut into 1/4-inch slices (2 cups)
- 1/2 cup oil
- 2 tbsp raw peanuts
- 2 tofu slices (about 9.5 oz) from a 19 oz carton packed in slices

Soy-sauce Dressing:
- 3 tbsp mushroom soy sauce or regular soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- 1/8 to 1/4 tsp hot red-pepper flakes

Mix bean sprouts and lettuce in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Prepare Soy-Sauce Dressing. Heat oil in a small saucepan to 375F. Add peanuts; fry until browned, being careful not to burn. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Cool; reserve oil. Crush peanuts in a mortar or with a rolling pin; set aside. Just before serving, remove tofu from container. Cut each slice in half through the side to make 4 thinner slices of the same size. Cut these slices in half crosswise, making 8 tofu slices. Reheat oil in saucepan. Fry tofu slices 2 or 3 at a time until lightly browned and puffy. Drain on paper towels; keep warm. To serve, mound lettuce mixture on a platter. Sprinkle with soy-sauce dressing. Place fried tofu around edges of salad. Sprinkle crushed peanuts over all. Makes 4 servings.

Soy-Sauce Dressing:
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl; let stand for 30 minutes or longer to blend flavors. Make 1/3 cup.
