# Smothered Cabbage
- 5 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large head green cabbage (3 lb), cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1.5 cups chicken broth
- 10 oz potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper

Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in cabbage, broth, potatoes, salt, and pepper and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until cabbage is wilted and potatoes are fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Increase heat to medium-high, uncover, and cook until liquid has nearly evaporated, about 12 minutes, gnetly stirring occasionally with rubber spatula. Serve.
